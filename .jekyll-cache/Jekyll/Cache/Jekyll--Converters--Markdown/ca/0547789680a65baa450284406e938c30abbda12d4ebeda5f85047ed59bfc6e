<h3 id="egr433-transforms-and-system-modeling-spring-semester">EGR433: Transforms and System Modeling (spring semester)</h3>

<p><b>Course Description</b>: This is a senior-level undergraduate class. Students will gain an understanding of the relationships between 
inputs and outputs in mechanical, electrical, and electro-mechanical systems, as well 
as learn the fundamental tools for control system analysis and design. Students will 
be curious about the transforms and modeling concepts, able to connect those concepts 
to real-world engineering systems, and apply those mathematical tools to improve the 
engineering systems and create values.</p>

<h3 id="egr556-system-control-and-optimization-fall-semester">EGR556: System Control and Optimization (fall semester)</h3>

<p><b>Course Description</b>: This is a mixed style graduate-level control class. The first 
part of the class will be lecture-based, and the instructor will introduce fundamental 
knowledge of state-space modeling and control. The second part of this class features 
a course project that students will study and apply advanced control techniques to 
real-world problems, including robotics, energy systems, autonomous vehicles, and 
chemical process. Students will start the course project early in the semester, and 
there will be dedicated class time for literature reviews, research discussions, and 
milestone presentations. The class will end with a final presentation and report. 
Each group will also make a poster and present their work in the innovation showcase 
at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>The ASU RISE LAB is committed to education and outreach, and the lab has actively participated 
in various local outreach events. We are excited to showcase our robotics research to anyone who 
is interested in learning more about it. The lab will open its door annually during ASU Night of 
the Open Door (late January) and National Robotics Week (mid April). You are also welcome to contact 
Dr. Zhang if you would like to schedule a tour of the lab outside those events.</p>
