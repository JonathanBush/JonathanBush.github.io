# Research

The overarching goal of our research is to develop novel learning and control algorithms to enable robots to safely and efficiently collaborate with humans and other robots to complete complex tasks. The algorithms are applied to various robot platforms, including wearable robotics, soft robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robot manipulators. Please check the summary of each project below and feel free to contact us if you have any questions or want to know more details!

We greatly acknowledge the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, Science Foundation Arizona, Arizona Department of Health Services, Salt River Project, Northrop Grumman Cooperation, and several internal funding sources, for supporting our past and current research.
